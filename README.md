# iDEA-masterclass

## Introduction to the repository
This is the repository of my work done in my Summer 2024 physics masterclass working on the iDEA code, supervised by Dr. Matt Hodgson.

All the work was done myself, Jamie Edwards.

The code is contained in a mixture of Jupiter notebooks and python files, which should return the achived results if ran.

## The project

The project had 3 main aims:

1) Prove correlation by iDEA to the analytical solution for a single particle time evolution.
Make tests to show potential updates in the code continue to correlate.
Automate those testâ€™s for push requests on GitHub.
